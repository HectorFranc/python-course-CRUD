# Python Curse (creating a CRUD)

In this repo you'll found some examples of python scripts. I'm improving my python skills.

## Managment Client System

This is the final project, a managment client system (a CRUD). It's a CMD line app (uses Click framework), that creates a csv "database", and you are able to:
- Create clients
- List clients
- Update clients
- Delete clients
- Search clients
